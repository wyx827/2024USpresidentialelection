\subsection{Measurement}\label{measurement}

Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an
entry in the dataset.

\subsection{Outcome variables}\label{outcome-variables}

Add graphs, tables and text. Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome
variable or update the subheading to be singular.

Some of our data is of penguins (\textbf{?@fig-bills}), from Horst,
Hill, and Gorman (2020).

Talk more about it.

And also planes (\textbf{?@fig-planes}). (You can change the height and
width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every
other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the
defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

Talk way more about it.

\subsection{Predictor variables}\label{predictor-variables}

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine
a few into one if they go together naturally.

\section{Model}\label{model}

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,\ldots{}

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to
investigate\ldots{} Background details and diagnostics are included in
Appendix~\ref{sec-model-details}.

\subsection{Logistic Regression Model Build
up}\label{logistic-regression-model-build-up}

To predict whether Donald Trump would win over Kamala Harris based on
polling data, we constructed a logistic regression model using a subset
of 1,000 randomly sampled observations from our cleaned dataset. The
dependent variable, trump\_win, is a binary outcome representing whether
Trump was predicted to win in a given state (1 for Trump win, 0 for
Harris win). The independent variables included in the model are
pollster\_rating\_name, state, population\_group, numeric\_grade,
sample\_size, and methodology.

We used the logit link function given that our outcome variable is
binary. The logistic regression model estimates the log odds of Trump
winning as a linear function of these predictors. Each predictor
variable was selected based on its relevance to polling outcomes:

\begin{verbatim}
•   pollster_rating_name captures the credibility of the polling firm, as rated by independent organizations.
•   state accounts for geographic variations in voter preferences.
•   population_group represents different demographic categories.
•   numeric_grade reflects the poll’s quality rating.
•   sample_size measures the size of the poll’s sample, which can impact the poll’s reliability.
•   methodology captures how the poll was conducted (e.g., online, phone-based, etc.).
\end{verbatim}

We applied a Bayesian approach to estimate the logistic regression model
using Stan, with weakly informative priors (Normal distribution with
mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5) for both the coefficients and the
intercept. These priors reflect our assumption that the effect of each
predictor is centered around 0, with a moderate level of uncertainty. By
incorporating state and demographic information along with pollster
quality and methodology, we aim to capture the variability in polling
predictions across different regions and polling practices. The use of
Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in our predictions
more effectively.

We use weakly informative Normal priors for the intercept ( \alpha ) and
coefficients ( \beta\_i ), centered around zero with a standard
deviation of 2.5. These priors were chosen to allow the data to
influence the predictions while still reflecting reasonable uncertainty.
Specifically:

\begin{align*}
y_i | \mu_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(\mu_i) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta_i &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma_i &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)
\end{align*}

\(logit(\mu_i) = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{pollster\_rating\_name}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{state}_i + \beta_3 \cdot \text{population\_group}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{numeric\_grade}_i + \beta_5 \cdot \text{sample\_size}_i + \beta_6 \cdot \text{methodology}_i\)

We run the model in R (R Core Team 2023) using the \texttt{rstanarm}
package of Goodrich et al. (2022). We use the default priors from
\texttt{rstanarm}.

\section{Pollster Methodology Overview and
Evaluation}\label{pollster-methodology-overview-and-evaluation}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Overview of SurveyUSA\\
}{Overview of SurveyUSA }}\label{overview-of-surveyusa}

SurveyUSA is a privately held opinion research company that operates
nationwide, across all 50 U.S. states. Since its founding, the company
has conducted over 40,000 research projects, serving a client base of
400 organizations, including media outlets, corporations, non-profits,
government agencies, and academic institutions. Known for its expertise
in localized opinion research, SurveyUSA focuses on gathering data at
the city, county, and regional levels. The company offers timely,
cost-effective surveys tailored to meet specific client needs,
distinguishing itself from larger global firms.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Population, Frame, and Sample\\
}{Population, Frame, and Sample }}\label{population-frame-and-sample}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Target Population: U.S. citizens eligible to vote in the 2024
  presidential election.\\
\item
  Sample Frame: U.S. households with either home telephones or access to
  devices such as phones or tablets.\\
\item
  Sample Size: Sample sizes vary across different polls. For the 2024
  U.S. presidential election cycle, SurveyUSA conducted 49 polls, with
  sample sizes ranging from 507 to 2,330 for registered voters or likely
  voters. The average sample size for these polls is approximately 1,045
  households.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Recruitment\\
}{Recruitment }}\label{recruitment}

SurveyUSA employs a mixed-method approach to recruitment, including
online panels, telephone calls, and a text-to-web method. Some
respondents are recruited through Random Digit Dialing (RDD) using
telephone samples purchased from Aristotle, while others, who do not use
home telephones, are invited to complete the survey on an electronic
device such as a phone or tablet. Respondents from non-probability
online panels are selected randomly by Cint/Lucid Holdings LLC.\\

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Sampling approach and Trade-offs\\
}{Sampling approach and Trade-offs }}\label{sampling-approach-and-trade-offs}

SurveyUSA uses a blend of probability and non-probability sampling
methods. Some respondents are drawn from non-probability online panels,
while others are recruited using probability-based telephone sampling.
Responses are weighted based on the latest U.S. Census estimates for
age, gender, ethnicity, and region, ensuring alignment with the target
population. Questions and answer choices are rotated to reduce order
bias, recency effects, and latency effects.\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Advantages:}\\
  The diverse sampling approach not only ensures a broad range of
  opinions is captured but also complements probability-based sampling,
  which accurately reflects the overall population. Furthermore,
  reweighting the data according to U.S. Census demographics strengthens
  the credibility of the results by ensuring demographic accuracy.
  Additionally, rotating questions and answer choices helps mitigate
  bias, further improving the reliability of the data. Finally, the use
  of online surveys offers a cost-effective solution for efficient data
  collection.\\
\item
  \textbf{Disadvantages:}\\
  Phone-based data collection tends to be time-consuming and can be
  affected by interviewer effects during telephone interviews.
  Additionally, challenges like non-response issues, such as busy
  signals or refusals to participate, can hinder the effectiveness of
  the data collection process.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Non-response Handling\\
}{Non-response Handling }}\label{non-response-handling}

In cases of non-response, SurveyUSA attempts follow-up calls if
interviews are interrupted by answering machines or busy signals.
Weighting is applied to adjust for non-response bias, although this
doesn't completely eliminate challenges posed by unreachable or
unwilling participants.\\

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Questionnaire Evaluation\\
}{Questionnaire Evaluation }}\label{questionnaire-evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Positive Aspects:} A logical flow between questions
  facilitates easy navigation for respondents throughout the survey,
  while simple wording promotes inclusivity by enabling individuals from
  diverse backgrounds to comprehend the questions. Furthermore, all
  questions are directly relevant to analyzing the 2024 U.S.
  presidential election, and providing predefined response options
  simplifies the choices for participants.\\
\item
  \textbf{Negative Aspects:} Static options for party affiliation and
  ideology may fail to capture the nuances of respondents' political
  beliefs. These rigid categories could oversimplify complex political
  identities.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Summary Evaluation\\
}{Summary Evaluation }}\label{summary-evaluation}

SurveyUSA's methodology reflects a balanced approach, leveraging various
sampling approach and method to reach a representative sample. While its
blend of probability and non-probability methods has strengths, such as
cost-effectiveness and broad reach, it faces challenges related to
telephone interview logistics, potential interviewer bias, and the
limitations of fixed questionnaire options. Nevertheless, the inclusion
of data weighting and question rotation adds credibility to its results,
making SurveyUSA a reliable pollster for localized opinion research.

\section{Appendix B: Idealized Methodology and
Survey}\label{appendix-b-idealized-methodology-and-survey}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Objective and
Overview}}{Objective and Overview}}\label{objective-and-overview}

The goal of this survey methodology is to accurately forecast the
outcome of the U.S. presidential election by collecting high-quality,
representative data from a diverse set of respondents across the
country. With a budget of \$100,000, this methodology incorporates
sophisticated sampling techniques, robust respondent recruitment
strategies, and rigorous data validation protocols. The approach is
designed to maximize accuracy, reduce bias, and account for various
demographic, geographic, and political factors that influence voting
behavior.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Core
Objectives}:}{Core Objectives:}}\label{core-objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtain a representative sample of the U.S. electorate.
\item
  Ensure data quality through rigorous validation.
\item
  Leverage statistical modeling and poll aggregation for an accurate
  prediction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. Sampling
Strategy}}{1. Sampling Strategy}}\label{sampling-strategy}

The sampling strategy is designed to ensure that the survey reaches a
broad, representative section of the voting population. To achieve this,
we will use \textbf{stratified random sampling} combined with
\textbf{quota sampling} for key demographics. This ensures that each
important subgroup within the population is adequately represented.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Stratification
Variables}:}{Stratification Variables:}}\label{stratification-variables}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Age Groups}: 18-29, 30-44, 45-64, 65+\\
\item
  \textbf{Gender}: Male, Female, Non-binary/Other\\
\item
  \textbf{Race/Ethnicity}: White, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian,
  Indigenous, Other\\
\item
  \textbf{Education Level}: No high school, High school graduate,
  College graduate, Post-graduate\\
\item
  \textbf{Income Bracket}: \textless\$30,000, \$30,000-\$60,000,
  \$60,000-\$100,000, \textgreater\$100,000\\
\item
  \textbf{Geographic Region}: Northeast, Midwest, South, West
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sample Size}:\\
A total of \textbf{10,000 respondents} will be surveyed, providing a
margin of error of approximately ±1\% at a 95\% confidence level. This
sample size will allow for detailed subgroup analysis (e.g., by state,
demographic group), yielding statistically robust predictions.

\textbf{Weighting}:\\
We will apply post-stratification weights to adjust for any oversampling
or undersampling of specific demographic groups. For example, younger
voters or underrepresented minorities will be weighted to reflect their
true proportions in the voting population.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Recruitment
Strategy}}{2. Recruitment Strategy}}\label{recruitment-strategy}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Recruitment
Channels}:}{Recruitment Channels:}}\label{recruitment-channels}

To maximize respondent diversity and ensure accurate sampling, the
survey will employ \textbf{multi-channel recruitment}:

  Facebook, Instagram, and Google will be used to recruit respondents
  based on their demographic profiles (age, gender, location, political
  interest). Custom audience features will be utilized to reach specific
  demographic and geographic groups.
\item
  \textbf{Email Outreach}: If permissible, we will access voter
  registration databases and send email invitations to registered
  voters. This will allow us to target specific voter demographics that
  are harder to reach via digital ads.
\item
  \textbf{Partnerships with Civic Organizations}: Partnering with
  non-profits and civic organizations that engage diverse communities
  (e.g., minority voter outreach programs) will further boost respondent
  diversity.
\item
  \textbf{Incentives}: To increase response rates, each participant will
  be entered into a lottery with a chance to win a \$100 gift card,
  encouraging broader participation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. Data Validation and Quality
Assurance}}{3. Data Validation and Quality Assurance}}\label{data-validation-and-quality-assurance}

Maintaining data integrity and ensuring high-quality responses are
critical to the accuracy of the election forecast. Therefore, several
measures will be put in place to validate responses and reduce noise in
the dataset.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Data Validation
Protocols}:}{Data Validation Protocols:}}\label{data-validation-protocols}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Real-time Captcha Verification}: This will prevent automated
  bots from submitting responses.
\item
  \textbf{Email/Phone Verification}: Respondents will verify their email
  or phone number to ensure authenticity. This ensures that each
  respondent only participates once.
\item
  \textbf{Time on Task Monitoring}: The survey platform will monitor the
  time respondents spend on each question. Responses completed
  suspiciously quickly (e.g., below 30\% of the average completion time)
  will be flagged for review or exclusion.
\item
  \textbf{Voter Registration Cross-Check}: If feasible, respondents will
  be cross-referenced with voter registration records to ensure they are
  eligible to vote in the upcoming election.
\item
  \textbf{Response Audits}: Randomly selected respondents will be
  contacted to verify the accuracy of their responses, ensuring
  integrity in the dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{4. Poll Aggregation and Data
Analysis}}{4. Poll Aggregation and Data Analysis}}\label{poll-aggregation-and-data-analysis}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Poll
Aggregation}:}{Poll Aggregation:}}\label{poll-aggregation}

This survey will be combined with results from reputable polling firms
(e.g., YouGov, Ipsos, Gallup) to strengthen our forecast through a
\textbf{poll-of-polls} approach.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Weighting by Methodology and Recency}: Poll results will be
  weighted based on the rigor of their methodology (e.g., online
  vs.~phone surveys, sample size) and the recency of the poll. Recent,
  methodologically sound polls will receive more weight in the
  aggregation process.
\item
  \textbf{Handling Bias and Variability}: Aggregated results will adjust
  for pollster house effects (biases in methodology) and variability
  between polls, ensuring that no single poll dominates the prediction.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Modeling
Approach}:}{Modeling Approach:}}\label{modeling-approach}

We will implement \textbf{Bayesian hierarchical models} to account for
variability across different states, demographics, and regions. This
will allow us to model the popular vote and potentially translate it
into \textbf{Electoral College predictions}.
